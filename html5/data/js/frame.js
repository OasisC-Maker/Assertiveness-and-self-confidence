an assertive person is confident and direct in dealing with others. assertive communications promote fairness and equality in human interactions, based on a positive sense of respect for self and

a person’s legitimate rights - without violating the rights of others or being overly fearful in the process. a skill that can be learned, assertive behavior is situational specific; meaning different types of assertive behavior can be used in different situations. assertive behavior involves three categories of skills; self-affirmation, expressing positive feelings, and expressing negative

passive, aggressive, passive-aggressive, and assertive. the passive person passive behavior is the avoidance of the expression of opinions or feelings, protecting one’s rights, and identifying and meeting one’s needs. passive individuals exhibit poor eye contact and slumped body posture, and tend to speak softly or apologetically. passive people express statements implying that: “i’m unable to stand up for my rights.” “i don’t know what my rights are.” “i get stepped on by everyone.\\" “i’m weak and unable to take care of myself.” “people never consider my feelings.” the aggressive person an aggressive individual communicates in a way that violates the rights of others. thus, aggressive communicators are verbally or physically abusive, or both. aggressive communication is born of low self-esteem, often caused by past physical or emotional abuse, unhealed emotional wounds, and feelings of powerlessness. aggressive individuals display a low tolerance for frustration, use humiliation, interrupt frequently, and use criticism or blame to attack others. they use piercing eye contact, and are not good listeners. aggressive people express statements implying that: the other person is inferior, wrong, and not worth anything the problem is the other person’s fault they are superior and right they will get their way regardless of the consequences they are entitled, and that the other person “owes” them. the passive-aggressive person the passive-aggressive person uses a communication style in which the individual appears passive on the surface, but is really acting out anger in a subtle, indirect, or behind-the-scenes way. passive-aggressive people usually feel powerless, stuck, and resentful. alienated from others, they feel incapable of dealing directly with the object of their resentments. rather, they express their anger by subtly undermining the real or imagined object of their resentments. frequently they mutter to themselves instead of confronting another person. they often smile at you, even though they are angry, use subtle sabotage, or speak with sarcasm. passive-aggressive individuals use communication that implies:  “i’m weak and resentful, so i sabotage, frustrate, and disrupt.” “i’m powerless to deal with you head on so i must use guerilla warfare.” “i will appear cooperative, but i’m not.” the assertive person an assertive individual communicates in a way that clearly states his or her opinions and feelings, and firmly advocates for his or her rights and needs without violating the rights of others. assertive communication is born of high self-esteem. assertive people value themselves, their time, and their emotional, spiritual, and physical needs. they are strong advocates for themselves -- while being very respectful of the rights of others. assertive people feel connected to other people. they make statements of needs and feelings clearly, appropriately, and respectfully. feeling in control of themselves, they speak in calm and clear tones, are good listeners, and maintain good eye contact. they create a respectful environment for others, and do not allow others to abuse or manipulate them. the assertive person uses statements that imply: “i am confident about who i am.” “i cannot control others, but i control myself.” “i speak clearly, honestly, and to the point.” “i know i have choices in my life, and i consider my options. i am fully responsible for my own happiness.” “we are equally entitled to express ourselves respectfully to one another.”"},{"kind":"slidetext","slideid":"6TQd6QdJ8kK.6FycTVeWd3e","slidebank":false,"type":"slide","Text":"case study module 2 slide 5 next  back

perceiving sound by the ear. assuming an individual is not hearing-impaired, hearing simply happens. listening, however, is something that one consciously chooses to do. listening requires concentration so that the brain processes meaning from words and sentences.  listening leads to learning, but this is not always an easy task. the normal adult rate of speech is 100-150 words per minute, but the brain can think at a rate of 400-500 words per minute, leaving extra time for daydreaming, or anticipating the speaker’s or the recipient’s next words. as opposed to hearing, listening skills can be learned and refined. the art of active listening allows you to fully receive a message from another person. especially in a situation involving anger or a tense interchange, active listening allows you to be sensitive to the multiple dimensions of communication that make up an entire message. these dimensions include: the occasion for the message: what is the reason why the person is communicating with me now? the length of the message: what can the length of the message tell me about its importance? the words chosen: is the message being made formally? is it with aloofness or slang? the volume and pace: what clues do the loudness and speed give me? the pauses and hesitations: how do these enhance or detract from the message? non-verbal clues: what does eye contact, posture, or facial expressions tell me about the message? empathy is the capability to share and understand another\'s emotions and feelings. empathetic listening is the art of seeking a truer understanding of how others are feeling. this requires excellent discrimination and close attention to the nuances of emotional signals. according to stephen covey in “the seven habits of highly effective people”, empathetic listening involves five basic tasks: 1.\\trepeat verbatim the content of the communication; the words, not the feelings 2.\\trephrase content; summarize the meaning of the words in your own words 3.\\treflect feelings; look more deeply and begin to capture feelings in your own words. look beyond words for body language and tone to indicate feelings. 4.\\trephrase contents and reflect feelings; express both their words and feelings in your own words. 5.\\tdiscern when empathy is not necessary - or appropriate.  back

elicit more information from speakers. below are three types of questions to use when practicing active listening. open questions open questions stimulate thinking and discussion or responses including opinions or feelings. they pass control of the conversation to the respondent. leading words in open questions include: why, what, or how, as in the following examples: tell me about the current employee orientation process. how do you open the emergency exit door on an a320 aircraft? clarifying questions a clarifying question helps to remove ambiguity, elicits additional detail, and guides the answer to a question. when you ask a clarifying question, you ask for expansion or detail, while withholding your judgment and own opinions. when asking for clarification, you will have to listen carefully to what the other person says. frame your question as someone trying to understand in more detail. often asking for a specific example is useful. this also helps the speaker evaluate his or her own opinions and perspective. below are some examples: i can tell you are really concerned about this. let me see if i can repeat to you your main concerns so we can start to think about what to do in this situation. what sort of savings are you looking to achieve? closed questions closed questions usually require a one-word answer, and effectively shut off discussion. closed questions provide facts, allow the questioner to maintain control of the conversation, and are easy to answer. typical leading words are: is, can, how many, or does. while closed questions are not the optimum choice for active listening, at times they may be necessary to elicit facts. below are several examples of closed questions: who will lead the meeting? do you know how to open the emergency exit door on this aircraft?  back "},{"kind":"slidetext","slideid":"6TQd6QdJ8kK.6BdIUcTMSt8","slidebank":false,"type":"slide","Text":"module 4 slide 4 body language next   body language is a form of non-verbal communication involving the use of stylized gestures, postures, and physiologic signs which act as cues to other people. humans unconsciously send and receive non-verbal signals through body language all the time. non-verbal communication is the process of communication through sending and receiving wordless messages. it is the single most powerful form of communication. nonverbal communication cues others about what is in your mind, even more than your voice or words can do. according to studies at ucla, as much as 93 percent of communication effectiveness is determined by nonverbal cues, and the impact of performance was determined 7 percent by the words used, 38 percent by voice quality, and 55 percent by non-verbal communication. in communication, if a conflict

chance of accomplishing it. relevant: before you even set goals, it’s a good idea to sit down and define your core values and your life purpose because it’s these tools which ultimately decide how and what goals you choose for your life. goals, in and of themselves, do not provide any happiness. goals that are in harmony with our life purpose do have the power to make us happy.  timed: without

involving the use of stylized gestures, postures, and physiologic signs which act as cues to other people. humans unconsciously send and receive non-verbal signals through body language all the time. one study at ucla found that up to 93 percent of communication effectiveness is determined by nonverbal cues. another study indicated that the impact of a performance was determined 7 percent by the words used, 38 percent by voice quality, and 55 percent by non-verbal communication. your body language must match the words used. if a conflict arises between your words and your body language, your body language governs. the components of body language include: eye contact: the impact of your message is affected by the amount of eye contact you maintain with the person with whom you are speaking. one who makes eye contact is normally perceived as more favorable and confident. posture: find comfortable sitting and standing postures that work for you; avoid any rigid or slouching positions. excessive or unrelated head, facial, hand and body movement: too much movement can divert attention from the verbal message. your facial expressions should match the type of statement you are making; smile when saying “i like you”, and frowning when saying “i am annoyed with you”. occasional gestures that reinforce your verbal message are acceptable. next  back

(“he was my worst hiring mistake…”) defaming him or her (we build consensus with others against the person) explaining the person in negative terms. anger also plays a big part; feeling angry, we instinctively use anger to try to manage the situation. to break the cycle of negativity, take time to answer the following questions: 1.\\twhat observable behaviors or statements did the person perform or say? 2.\\twhat is the most positive interpretation an outside witness would make? the most negative? 3.\\twhat will you gain by interpreting the difficult person’s actions or words in as positive a light as possible?

the length: what can the size of the message tell me about the importance of the message to the \\tperson? the words: does the person use formal, aloof language? impatience? the volume and pace: what emotional pressures can be sensed? note taking after a discussion a second tactic is to write down your recollection of the discussion that just took place. the notes can be used to support your next communication with the difficult person. note taking also gives you the opportunity to plan and organize before the next communication takes place. writing your communication putting your thoughts into writing has three important benefits: 1.\\tthe difficult person cannot interrupt with an objection 2.\\tit’s easier to provide orderly communication in writing than in a discussion 3.\\twritten communication is pure; there is no body language to shape the outcome, reducing the possibility of mixed messages.  next  back "},{"kind":"slidetext","slideid":"6TQd6QdJ8kK.6IYuo03rXnn","slidebank":false,"type":"slide","Text":"case study module 11 slide 4 next  back  "},{"kind":"slidetext","slideid":"6TQd6QdJ8kK.68cIhuwzGsb","slidebank":false,"type":"slide","Text":" which of the following is not an innate coping filter for dealing with difficult people?
